# KAMOS

A discovery and tracking platform for Japanese alcoholic beverages — Nihonshu, Shochu, and beyond.

Named after *醸す (kamosu)*, the Japanese verb for brewing and fermenting, KAMOS is to Japanese craft spirits what Untappd is to beer: a place to log what you've tried, discover what's next, and share the experience with people who care as much as you do.

## What you can do

**Discover** a curated database of beverages with brewery profiles, flavor profiles, regional origins, and brewing details — searchable and browseable across three languages.

**Check in** with a rating, tasting notes, flavor tags, price, and photos. Every check-in builds an aggregated flavor portrait for each beverage over time.

**Follow** other users and see their check-ins in a live feed. Profiles can be public or private.

**Collect** bottles into personal lists — the default Inventory and Wishlist, or any custom list you create.

## Quick start

```sh
# Local dev — Postgres in docker, API + worker on host
make up                          # postgres + api in docker-compose
make db-migrate                  # apply migrations
make smoke                       # 18-step integration smoke (requires API up)

cd frontend && flutter run       # mobile app against http://localhost:8080
cd admin && npm install && npm run dev  # admin SPA against http://localhost:8080
```

Hosted environment (auto-deploys on every merge to `main`):
